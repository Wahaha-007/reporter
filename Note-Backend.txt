I am designing backend for Mobile App.
The mobile apps is written in ReactNative. 
It gets the problem reports from users and write into DynamoDB with the following data model.

Table : 'Report'
----------------
report_id (Partition key) String
department String ( Possible values : HR/Facility/Production/Finance/Maintenance )
details String
imageUrl String
location Map
status String (There are 4 possible statuses : Report/Ack/Processing/Done
topic String
username String (in Email format)
createdAt String

Since there are 4 different statuses, there are also other 3 tables for each status. 
They have the common attribute : report_id.

Table : 'ReportAck', 'ReportProcessing', 'ReportDone'
-----------------------------------------------------
report_id (Partition key) String
comment String
CratedAt String
imageUrl String
updater String
updater_role String

There are the updaters from each department who will update the status of each report_id in respective table.
updater_role : HR-Worker, Facility-Worker, Production-Worker, Finance-Worker, Maintenance-Worker.

For the Admin web design, we need to make a simple dashboard with JS and the backend with NodeJS.
It should display
1. Pending isssues for each department
2. Duration between status transfer like from 'Report' -> 'Ack', from 'Ack' -> 'Processing'
   This data can display the responsiveness of each department to solve to problem.

Let's make the plan for making Admin web.

================================================================================

Next, let's make the first dashboard with the following data.
1. User can see it when visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard/remaining
   This should be a html file with some code inside

2. This page has upper half and lower half
   Upper half : Displays a graph using ChartJS. It is a stacked bar chart
   - X-Axis is department
   - Y-Axis is number of report at each stage

   Lower half : When the user click at some area of the chart for example click at 'Ack' of the 'HR' department
                This lower half section will show the data in table format of details according to 'Ack' status report of 'HR' department.

   In order to do this, we also need to add more route for api backend to get the appropriated data from database. 


----------------------------------

There are many points we need to discuss, just discuss, no coding.
1. When we count the report.
   Can we make the GSI for the table 'Report' column 'status' and count from there ?
   For example, for 'HR' department, if there are 3 records in table 'ReportDone' and there are 6 records in table 'ReportProcessing'.
   It means that only 3 records are really 'processing' (because other 3 already in 'Done')
   Counting record from all table will not give the correct result to display to the stacked chart.

2. Table 'Report' is the main table that have 'report_id' for each status. We can use the this list to make table when user click the graph area.


What do you think ?


=========================================================================

Let' make another dashboard. We will discuss first and make the coding later.
This time we want the dashboard to show "Time to change report status". A single report has 4 statuses so it should have 3 'Status changes' in between.
What types of graph or representations are suitable to display Status tus change' time to compare the performance between department ?

-------------------------------------

Well, there are 3 types I think we should try first : Box Plot, Heatmap, Radar.

--------------------------------------

Let's use Javascript, plotly / Chart.JS
