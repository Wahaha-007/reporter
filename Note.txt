I want to develop the apps in ReactNative (with Expo) that has 2 screens.
Make Just the first screen 'ReportScreen' for me with the following specs.
1. Black theme
2. It is like a form that let user fill in the report. Copmpose of 
  - Topic : User type input, there is also a small microphone icon for sound input ( will implement logic later)
  - Picture : There is button, if user press it will let user take photo / get image from library. There is also retake/reselect photo option. Use 'Expo ImagePicker'.
  - Details : let user fill in the details, again there is microphone icon
  - Reponsible department : User can swipe left / right to select the icon of responsible department.
    You can mock the icon like 'HR','Facility','Production','Maintenance','Finance','QA'. Using icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons' 
  - The submit button.
3. Afer user press submit button, make the mock function that just console.log all input data above.
