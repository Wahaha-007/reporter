I want to develop the apps in ReactNative (with Expo) that has 2 screens.
Make Just the first screen 'ReportScreen' for me with the following specs.
1. Black theme
2. It is like a form that let user fill in the report. Copmpose of 
  - Topic : User type input, there is also a small microphone icon for sound input ( will implement logic later)
  - Picture : There is button, if user press it will let user take photo / get image from library. There is also retake/reselect photo option. Use 'Expo ImagePicker'.
  - Details : let user fill in the details, again there is microphone icon
  - Reponsible department : User can swipe left / right to select the icon of responsible department.
    You can mock the icon like 'HR','Facility','Production','Maintenance','Finance','QA'. Using icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons' 
  - The submit button.
3. Afer user press submit button, make the mock function that just console.log all input data above.



I think we should add the location so that the user can pick the location on the map and then also send that location data 
with other information. Also, use can add his/her name but if not add , just make the default to anonymous.
After user press submit ,just clear data in this page and navigate user to "Status" page.


Just answer the related code and tell me where to change.  
For the responsible Department, I want it the show the big Icon of each department and the name below. 
Also, can we make it so that use can really swipe left/right to change the selection ?
